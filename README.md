**Reupload of a university Project that was located on the university repository.**

In this project, we created a web app where visitors can view a live stream of an aquarium
called “OnlyFish”. The web app also features the ability for the viewer to call an object
recognition model to detect fish in the current frame, as well as the ability to toggle the
aquarium lights with the push of a button. This feature is aimed at the owner of the aquarium
and can only be used if the correct passcode is given.
The goal of this project was to gain knowledge in the area of cloud computing and setting up
a cloud infrastructure for live video streaming with an end-to-end solution.
The final architecture of the project can be seen in the image below.
